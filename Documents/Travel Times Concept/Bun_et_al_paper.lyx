Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Municipal solid waste landfills are very complex and heterogeneous systems
 containing a heterogeneous mixture of a wide range of materials.
 A number of processes of different nature occur within landfills.
 Bio-geochemical processes in a landfill body lead to the development of
 landfill gases.
 Water flow through the landfill is the main driving force for leachate
 generation.
 This induces loss of matter via leachate and gas generation as a result
 new pores become available for water flow and settlements take place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A transport function approach in combination with travel times is used in
 this study to simulate dynamics of quantity and quality of leachate draining
 into the drainage system of the landfill.
 Our research aims to estimate the remaining emission potential of the landfill
 under different landfill management scenarios using the data observed from
 these dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transport function approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is virtually impossible to observe processes within full scale landfills
 in high detail because of difficulties in accessing the waste body.
 Easily obtainable information is the amount of water from rainfall, irrigation
 and recirculation infiltrating in to the waste body, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{in}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, and the amount and quality of leachate pumped out of the drainage system,
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{out}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{out}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 The challenge we face is to use this information to obtain a quantitative
 estimate of the concentrations of compounds of interest within the waste
 body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that every single injection at the inlet of the landfill will
 cause log-normally distributed response at the outlet.
 In order to calculate final outflux we integrate all the responses to injection
s that happened in the past:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{out}\left(t\right)=\int_{0}^{t}q_{in}\left(t-\tau\right)\cdot f\left(\tau\right)d\tau,\label{eq:Q_out}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 is a log-normal probability density function (PDF).
 In this equation, the leachate volume flux 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{out}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 leaving the landfill at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, is considered to consist of water that entered the waste body at earlier
 times 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t-\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 multiplied by the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\tau\right)\cdot d\tau$
\end_inset

 of water in the landfill having a travel time.
 Figure

 illustrates an example of application of this concept for a set of arbitrary
 parameters.

\begin_layout Standard
Our speculation is that leachate discharge rates and concentrations of compounds
 in it are highly related to each other (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Laner2011"

\end_inset

).
 In addition, because rainfall is assumed to be clean, leachate quality
 is related to concentrations of compounds present inside the waste body
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{rem}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c_{out}\left(t\right)=F\left(q_{out}\left(t\right),c_{rem}\left(t\right)\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All water entering the landfill will flow through the waste body according
 to the water flow PDF which is related to travel time (or residence time)
 according to a given distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Q_out"

\end_inset

.
 During its residence inside the waste body, compounds dissolved in the
 water participate in bio-geochemical reactions leading to changes in the
 dissolved species.
 When the water reaches the drainage layer this water will become leachate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the approach we adopt a simple approach where we implement
 a scenario where all mass is present in solution, we assume that all mobile
 water in a streamline is well mixed, exchange between the mobile and the
 immobile water is driven by the concentration gradient and that the dissolved
 compounds undergo a first order degradation in the immobile water.
 The concentrations in mobile and immobile water 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{im}$
\end_inset

 are described by the following set of coupled equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_{m}\left(\tau\right)}{\partial\tau} & =-v_{m}\cdot k_{ex}\cdot\left(c_{m}\left(\tau\right)-c_{im}\left(\tau\right)\right);\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial c_{im}\left(\tau\right)}{\partial\tau} & =v_{im}\cdot k_{ex}\cdot\left(c_{m}\left(\tau\right)-c_{im}\left(\tau\right)\right)-\lambda\cdot c_{im}\left(\tau\right).\label{eq:c_out_exchange_decay}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a parameter describing the rate of decay and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{ex}$
\end_inset

 the rate of exchange between the immobile and mobile water, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{im}$
\end_inset

 are the volumes of liquid in mobile and immobile phases respectively.
 The concentration at the outlet at time t is then calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c\left(t\right)=\frac{m_{out}\left(t\right)}{q_{out}\left(t\right)},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{out}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is a sum of all individual masses of solutes contained in particles leaving
 the waste body at current time step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{out}\left(t\right)=\int_{0}^{t}c_{out}\left(t,\,\tau\right)\cdot q_{in}\left(t-\tau\right)\cdot f\left(\tau\right)\, d\tau.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{out}\left(t,\,\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 is a solution of the system of ODEâ€™s 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:c_out_exchange_decay"

\end_inset

 solved with initial conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}\left(0\right)=c_{rem,m}\left(t-\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}\left(0\right)=c_{rem,imm}\left(t-\tau\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to verify the approach we model leaching in laboratory scale experiment
s in a 2D set-up containing a mixture of sand and salt with randomly placed
 impermeable plastic barriers.
 Fresh water is supplied at known (varying) infiltration fluxes, discharge
 rates as well as electrical conductivity are measured in the drainage tube
 of the system.
 Using these data we will aim to estimate the development of the salt mass
 present in the landfill during the experiments.
 A modification of marker-in-cell method

 and finite cell method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is used for simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These experiments will also provide us with shapes of response functions
 to individual injections.
 Such shapes are intended to eventually replace log-normal distribution
 PDF used in a current study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research is carried out on modeling bio-geochemical processes in the
 landfills using a set of minimum required parameters.
 This model will eventually replace exponential decay model used before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach will be applied to data obtained from three full-scale landfills
 in the Netherlands.
