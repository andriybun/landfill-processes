abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are potential long-term sources of emissions. Hence, they need to be managed after closure until they do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The case study on the Breitenau MSW landfill was performed to evaluate future emission levels for this site and to illustrate the effect of final cover installation with respect to long-term environmental risks. The methodology was based on a comprehensive assessment of the state of the landfill and included analysis of monitoring data, investigations of landfilled waste, and an evaluation of containment systems. A model to estimate future emission levels was established and site-specific predictions of leachate emissions were presented based on scenario analysis. The results are used to evaluate the future pollution potential of the landfill and to compare different aftercare concepts in view of long-term emissions. As some leachable substances became available for water flow during cover construction due to a change in the water flow pattern of the waste, a substantial increase in leachate concentrations could be observed at the site (e.g. concentrations of chloride increased from 200 to 800mg/l and of ammonia-nitrogen from 140 to about 500mg/l). A period of intensive flushing before the final cover installation could have reduced the amount of leachable substances within the landfill body and rapidly decreased the leachate concentrations to 11mg Cl/l and 79mg NH(4)-N/l within 50years. Contrarily, the minimization of water infiltration is associated with leachate concentrations in a high range for centuries (above 400mg Cl/l and 200mg NH(4)-N/l) with low concomitant annual emission loads (below 12kg/year of Cl or 9kg/year of NH(4)-N, respectively). However, an expected gradual decrease of barrier efficiency over time would be associated with higher emission loads of 50kg of chloride and 30kg of ammonia-nitrogen at the maximum, but a faster decrease of leachate concentration levels.},
