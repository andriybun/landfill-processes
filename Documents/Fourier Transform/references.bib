abstract = {Vertical wells are frequently used as a means of controlling leachate levels in landfills. They are often the only available dewatering option for both old landfills without any basal leachate collection layer and for newer sites where the installed drainage infrastructure has failed. When the well is pumped, a seepage face develops at the entry into the well so that the drawdown in the surrounding waste will not be as great as might be expected. The numerical groundwater flow model MODFLOW-SURFACT, which contains the functionality to model seepage surfaces, has been used to investigate the transient dewatering of a landfill. The study concludes that the position of the seepage face and information about the characteristics of the induced seepage flow field are important and should not be neglected when designing wells in landfills.},

abstract = {The paper is concerned with application and benefits of MC simulation proposed for estimating the life of a modern municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill. The software Crystal Ball® (CB), simulation program that helps analyze the uncertainties associated with Microsoft® Excel models by MC simulation, was proposed to calculate the transit time contaminants in porous media. The transport of contaminants in soil is represented by the one-dimensional (1D) form of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE). The computer program CONTRANS written in MATLAB language is foundation to simulate and estimate the thickness of landfill compacted clay liner. In order to simplify the task of determining the uncertainty of parameters by the MC simulation, the parameters corresponding to the expression Z2 taken from this program were used for the study. The tested parameters are: hydraulic gradient (HG), hydraulic conductivity (HC), porosity (POROS), linear thickness (TH) and diffusion coefficient (EDC). The principal output report provided by CB and presented in the study consists of the frequency chart, percentiles summary and statistics summary. Additional CB options provide a sensitivity analysis with tornado diagrams. The data that was used include available published figures as well as data concerning the Mittal Steel Poland (MSP) S.A. in Krak\'{o}w, Poland. This paper discusses the results and show that the presented approach is applicable for any MSW landfill compacted clay liner thickness design.},

abstract = {The flow of water through Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills is highly non-uniform and dominated by preferential pathways. Thus, concepts to simulate landfill behavior require that a heterogeneous flow regime is considered. Recent models are based on a 2-domain approach, differentiating between channel domain with high hydraulic conductivity, and matrix domain of slow water movement with high water retention capacity. These models focus on the mathematical description of rapid water flow in channel domain. The present paper highlights the importance of water exchange between the two domains, and expands the 1-dimensional, 2-domain flow model by taking into account water flows in two dimensions. A flow field consisting of a vertical path (channel domain) surrounded by the waste mass (matrix domain) is defined using the software HYDRUS-2D. When the new model is calibrated using data sets from a MSW-landfill site the predicted leachate generation corresponds well with the observed leachate discharge. An overall model efficiency in terms of r(2) of 0.76 was determined for a simulation period of almost 4 years. The results confirm that water in landfills follows a preferential path way characterized by high permeability (K(s)=300 m/d) and zero retention capacity, while the bulk of the landfill (matrix domain) is characterized by low permeability (K(s)=0.1m/d) and high retention capacity. The most sensitive parameters of the model are the hydraulic conductivities of the channel domain and the matrix domain, and the anisotropy of the matrix domain.},

abstract = {Investigations into laboratory reactors and landfills are used for simulating and predicting emissions from municipal solid waste landfills. We examined water flow and solute transport through the same waste body for different volumetric scales (laboratory experiment: 0.08 m(3), landfill: 80,000 m(3)), and assessed the differences in water flow and leachate emissions of chloride, total organic carbon and Kjeldahl nitrogen. The results indicate that, due to preferential pathways, the flow of water in field-scale landfills is less uniform than in laboratory reactors. Based on tracer experiments, it can be discerned that in laboratory-scale experiments around 40\% of pore water participates in advective solute transport, whereas this fraction amounts to less than 0.2\% in the investigated full-scale landfill. Consequences of the difference in water flow and moisture distribution are: (1) leachate emissions from full-scale landfills decrease faster than predicted by laboratory experiments, and (2) the stock of materials remaining in the landfill body, and thus the long-term emission potential, is likely to be underestimated by laboratory landfill simulations.},

abstract = {The numerical computer models that simulate municipal solid waste (MSW) bioreactor landfills have mainly two components--a biodegradation process module and a multi-phase flow module. The biodegradation model describes the chemical and microbiological processes. The models available to date include predefined solid waste biodegradation reactions and participating species. Some of these models allow changing the basic composition of solid waste. In a bioreactor landfill several processes like anaerobic and aerobic solids biodegradation, nitrogen and sulfate related processes, precipitation and dissolution of metals, and adsorption and gasification of various anthropogenic organic compounds occur simultaneously. These processes may involve reactions of several species and the available biochemical models for solid waste biodegradation do not provide users with the flexibility to simulate these processes by choice. This paper presents the development of a generalized biochemical process model BIOKEMOD-3P which can accommodate a large number of species and process reactions. This model is able to simulate bioreactor landfill operation in a completely mixed condition, when coupled with a multi-phase model it will be able to simulate a full-scale bioreactor landfill. This generalized biochemical model can simulate laboratory and pilot-scale operations in order to determine biochemical parameters important for simulation of full-scale operations.},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of real bioreactor landfills in the anaerobic methanogenic phase. This coupled model is composed of a two-phase flow and a biological model based on Darcy's law and Monod's model, respectively. This model considers bacterial activity and biological behavior as a function of temperature and makes it possible to study the thermo-biological behavior of bioreactor landfills with temperature changes. In this model we consider different effects of saturation on solid waste degradation. These effects consist of increasing hydrolysis with saturation and also decreasing the concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and activating the methanogenic biomass. This paper presents first the mathematical coupled model and the numerical methods used to solve the conservation equations. The numerical model is then used to simulate two bioreactor landfills. This paper presents the results of long and short (with leachate recirculation) term numerical simulations comparing them with site results. Finally results as well as advantages and drawbacks of the model are discussed. The results show that the mathematical model is able to reproduce the hydro-thermo-biological behavior of a bioreactor landfill in different conditions, with and without leachate recirculation, and leads to a better understanding of important thermal and biological parameters.},

abstract = {Forecasting settlements of non-hazardous waste is essential to ensure the integrity and durability of landfill covers over time. Over a short time span, the survey of settlements may also contribute to the investigation of the biodegradation processes. This paper addresses secondary settlements of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), a heterogeneous and time-evolving material. An analysis of available experimental data from different pilots and the literature was conducted to quantify the influence of biodegradation on MSW secondary settlements. After making assumptions about the various features of the waste and their constitutive relationships, a one-dimensional biomechanical model to predict the secondary settlement has been developed. The determination of the total secondary settlement was obtained by the addition of two separate parts, the mechanical settlement, due to creep, and the biochemical settlement, due to the degradation of the organic matter. The latter has been evaluated based on the observed biogas production. Using the data from different recent large-scale experiments that provide a monitoring of biogas production, a method for predicting the biochemically-induced settlements is proposed and validated on these tests. The relative contributions of mechanical and biochemical settlements are also calculated and discussed as a function of waste pre-treatment and operation conditions (biological pre-treatment, shredding, leachate injection). Finally, settlement may be considered as a relevant indicator for the state of biodegradation.},

abstract = {Long term methane emissions from landfill sites are often predicted by first-order decay (FOD) models, in which the default coefficients of the methane generation potential and the methane generation rate given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are usually used. However, previous studies have demonstrated the large uncertainty in these coefficients because they are derived from a calibration procedure under ideal steady-state conditions, not actual landfill site conditions. In this study, the coefficients in the FOD model were estimated by a new approach to predict more precise long term methane generation by considering region-specific conditions. In the new approach, age-defined waste samples, which had been under the actual landfill site conditions, were collected in Hokkaido, Japan (in cold region), and the time series data on the age-defined waste sample's methane generation potential was used to estimate the coefficients in the FOD model. The degradation coefficients were 0.0501/y and 0.0621/y for paper and food waste, and the methane generation potentials were 214.4 mL/g-wet waste and 126.7 mL/g-wet waste for paper and food waste, respectively. These coefficients were compared with the default coefficients given by the IPCC. Although the degradation coefficient for food waste was smaller than the default value, the other coefficients were within the range of the default coefficients. With these new coefficients to calculate methane generation, the long term methane emissions from the landfill site was estimated at 1.35×10(4)m(3)-CH(4), which corresponds to approximately 2.53\% of the total carbon dioxide emissions in the city (5.34×10(5)t-CO(2)/y).},

abstract = {Hydraulic properties of waste and cover soil from Kimpo Metropolitan Landfill were experimentally measured by laboratory tests. The degree of compaction was changed to identify the effect on hydraulic conductivity, field capacity, and permanent wilting point. Properties were utilized in developing a reliable numerical tool for leachate analysis. HELP, a simulation model for hydrologic evaluation of landfill performance, was adopted for that purpose. For calibration, results from simulation using the parameter values measured by laboratory tests were compared against the field data. The model was applied to predict the leachate level change according to the degree of compaction and cover soil thickness variation. It was found that the increase in the degree of compaction for intermediate cover soil and waste results in the decrease of field capacity and hydraulic conductivity, hence, the increase of leachate level. The effect of cover layer thickness on the leachate level was minor. Based on the findings from laboratory and numerical experiments, a guideline for reclamation practice was recommended.},

abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are potential long-term sources of emissions. Hence, they need to be managed after closure until they do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The case study on the Breitenau MSW landfill was performed to evaluate future emission levels for this site and to illustrate the effect of final cover installation with respect to long-term environmental risks. The methodology was based on a comprehensive assessment of the state of the landfill and included analysis of monitoring data, investigations of landfilled waste, and an evaluation of containment systems. A model to estimate future emission levels was established and site-specific predictions of leachate emissions were presented based on scenario analysis. The results are used to evaluate the future pollution potential of the landfill and to compare different aftercare concepts in view of long-term emissions. As some leachable substances became available for water flow during cover construction due to a change in the water flow pattern of the waste, a substantial increase in leachate concentrations could be observed at the site (e.g. concentrations of chloride increased from 200 to 800mg/l and of ammonia-nitrogen from 140 to about 500mg/l). A period of intensive flushing before the final cover installation could have reduced the amount of leachable substances within the landfill body and rapidly decreased the leachate concentrations to 11mg Cl/l and 79mg NH(4)-N/l within 50years. Contrarily, the minimization of water infiltration is associated with leachate concentrations in a high range for centuries (above 400mg Cl/l and 200mg NH(4)-N/l) with low concomitant annual emission loads (below 12kg/year of Cl or 9kg/year of NH(4)-N, respectively). However, an expected gradual decrease of barrier efficiency over time would be associated with higher emission loads of 50kg of chloride and 30kg of ammonia-nitrogen at the maximum, but a faster decrease of leachate concentration levels.},

The coupled model can be used to simulate and predict the distributions of gas and water pressure as well as total waste settlement. Model verification indicates that because of degradation, the excess pore gas pressure increases rapidly and reaches a peak value in a short time, and then it dissipates gradually. But the excess pore water pressure may not always increase at the beginning, which depends on hydraulic conductivity of MSW. Dissipation of the excess pore water pressure is slower than that of the excess pore gas pressure. A waste settlement experiment was conducted in the laboratory using a synthetic MSW. The data was used to verify the developed model, which gave satisfactory results. Based on the experimental results, a new formula is proposed to simulate biochemical degradation.},

abstract = {Among the landfill simulation programs being developed by several research groups around the world as tools for the management of sanitary landfills is MODUELO, whose second version, MODUELO 2, has been presented elsewhere. It reproduces the operational history of the landfill and its hydrologic and biodegradation processes, allowing the estimation of the flow and pollutants emitted in the leachate and the generated landfill gas over time. This program has been used for a diagnosis study of an existing European MSW landfill. The construction and calibration of the facility's hydrologic model, based on the available data, allowed the detection and quantification of two sources increasing the flows reaching the leachate collection system: a small portion (6-7\%) of the runoff over the landfill surface and the contribution of water coming from external hillsides of the same watershed that represent a total surface area of around 20ha. The contrast of the leachate quality (COD, BOD, NH(4)-N and TKN) simulation results and measured data showed the potential of these models for the assessment of other significant aspects in landfill operation such as the potential harnessing of the landfill gas. Nonetheless, in this case as in many others, the accuracy of the simulation results was limited by the scant quality of the available data, which highlights the need for implementing continuous monitoring and characterizing protocols to take advantage of these programs as a tool for landfill optimization.},

abstract = {The moisture retention and compression characteristics of municipal solid waste under self-weight are likened to those of an unsaturated soil. By assuming that the solid organic fraction in waste retains a relatively immobile micropore moisture and that deformation at low confining stress occurs at the expense of a relatively large macropore system, an insight into the variation of density and moisture with depth can be gained. With data on the composition of the waste, the phase composition can be extended to distinguish between solid organic and solid inorganic fractions, resulting in a four phase material model. The model is developed using detailed moisture and waste composition data from the Lyndhurst Sanitary Landfill site in Victoria, Australia. Finally, comparison of the model with large scale compression test results provides an insight into the nature of waste compression and moisture content data at low confining stress.},

The results of the tests are described and discussed, with reference to their implications for the flow and control of leachate in landfills.

abstract = {Dye tracer studies revealed that earthworm burrows in the compacted plough pan of a Chinese paddy rice field can serve as preferential flow paths. It is, however, unclear whether the observed bypass of the compacted soil horizon might be explained by differences in hydraulic properties between the plough pan, the worm burrows with a surrounding denser drilosphere and the un-compacted subsoil, or by lower-permeable macropore walls. The objective is to separately analyse effects of the individual flow domains and to identify possible limiting factors (bottlenecks) in the flow system for better soil drainage management. Hydraulic properties are inversely estimated from in situ measurements of pressure heads and evaporation by using HYDRUS\_1D code. Field data of 2D pressure head progression after dye tracer infiltration in the vicinity of worm burrows are simulated using HYDRUS\_2D. The axisymmetric 2D flow model considers a highly permeable cylindrical macropore region in the centre of the flow domain, assuming Darcy's law is valid. The match between simulated and measured pressure head fields improved after including a lower-permeable drilosphere pore domain. Scenario simulations show that the inflow into the 'bypass-flow' domain are reduced by the homogenized topsoil (i.e., after puddling) and limited if the macropore domain is relatively shallow. The results suggest that basic structural features may in this concept be considered as one possibility to describe observed preferential flow patterns. The separate consideration of soil structural effects may help developing and improving management strategies for manipulation of preferential flow in soils of paddy fields.},

Aspects such as the municipal solid waste (MSW) initial water content, mass loss due to decomposition, MSW liquid expelling due to compression and those related to weather conditions, such as the amount of rainfall and evaporation are considered. Superficial flow and infiltration were modeled considering the waste and the hydraulic characteristics (permeability and soil-water retention curves) of the cover layer and simplified uni-dimensional empirical models. In order to validate the modeling procedure, data from one cell at the landfill were used. Monthly waste entry, volume of collected leachate and leachate level inside the cell were monitored. Water balance equations and the compressibility of the MSW were used to calculate the amount of leachate stored in the cell and the corresponding leachate level. Measured and calculated values of the leachate level inside the cell were similar and the model was able to capture the main trends of the water balance behavior during the cell operational period.},

The CH4 generation model was calibrated by actual CH4 recovery and emission measurement data. Moreover, waste characterisation information from a previous study was considered. The appropriate k for bulk waste was 0.18 in the studied landfill, which indicated a higher rate of degradation than proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a default k value of 0.09 for wet conditions in boreal and temperate climes, whereas the calibrated L of 100 m(3)/t was lower than estimated on the basis of a previous waste characterisation study. The results demonstrate the importance of model calibration, as inappropriate model parameters may result in a large discrepancy (approximately 100 \% or 119 million m(3) having an energy equivalent of nearly 1.2 TWh) in cumulative CH4 generation estimates within a 18-year timescale (2012-30) at the studied landfill.},

abstract = {Tortuosity phenomena of pore spare influence the transport of water, solutes, and gases in soil. This study presents three analyses linking tortuosity and transport in unsaturated soil. The first is a diffusion-based analysis of tortuosity in the soil water and soil air phases, related to soil surface area (SA) and pore-size distribution (PSD) (characterized by Campbell b and content of pores > 30 mum). The analysis is based on recent models to predict the diffusion coefficients, D-p, of (i) a solute in soil, (ii) a gas in repacked soil, and (iii) a gas in undisturbed soil, each as a function of fluid-phase (soil water or soil air) content, alpha. For use in the analysis, the relation between SA and the threshold water content where solute diffusion ceases due to disconnected water films was measured for eight soils (5-46\% clay). The tortuosity analysis supported by measured D-p(alpha) data shows that SA governs and has a larger impact on liquid-phase tortuosity than PSD has on gaseous-phase tortuosity, At the same value of a, the tortuosity is typically larger in the soil water than in the soil air phase, and the difference becomes more pronounced with increasing SA and at low alpha. In the second analysis air permeability, k(a), and gas diffusivity, D-P,D-g, are linked in the Millington and Quirk fluid now model to describe soil structure-forming potential and to establish a model platform to describe k(a) as a function of D-P,D-g and alpha. Measurements on repacked, nonaggregated soil support the k(a)(D-P,D-g;alpha) model platform, while measurements on repacked, aggregated soils and on undisturbed soils show that k(a) is greatly affected by soil aggregation and structure and D-P,D-g is not, In the third analysis, a constitutive parameter model is applied to gas and solute diffusivities and air and water permeabilities in six soils along a soil texture gradient. This illustrates the different behavior of the four transport parameters with PSD and alpha. The liquid-phase transport parameters show a steeper decrease with a compared with the gaseous-phase parameters, in part due to the higher tortuosity in the liquid phase. Also, k(a) in undisturbed soil exhibited a less steep decrease with alpha compared with D-P,D-g, probably due to preferential air flow in larger pores during convective transport. Any attempt to develop a unifying and PSD-dependent model for transport parameters in the soil liquid and gaseous phases Hill require careful distinction between repacked and undisturbed soils.},

Waste, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), methanogenic biomass and sodium concentrations are the model variables. Diffusion and advection of VFAs inhibiting both polymer hydrolysis and methanogenesis were considered. A sensitivity analysis by changing the key model parameter values was carried out. The model simulations showed that the effective distance between the areas of hydrolysis/acidogenesis and methanogenesis is very important. An initial spatial separation of rich waste and inoculum enhances the methane production and waste degradation at high waste loading if relatively low VFA diffusion into the methanogenic area is taking place. When both hydrolysis and methanogenesis are strongly inhibited by high levels of VFA, fluctuations in biomass concentration are thought to be responsible for initiating the expansion of methanogenic area over the reactor space.},

abstract = {The management of sanitary landfills after closure is an important engineering, economic and sustainability issue and is referred to as the greatest unresolved landfill challenge. Most sanitary landfills are operated according to the dry tomb principle, resulting in aftercare periods of hundreds of years. To study landfill body behaviour, long-term leachate emissions were studied with anaerobic landfill simulators, and a forecast model was developed targeting the behaviour of NH(4)-N, COD and chlorides as a function of temperature and the L/S-ratio (liquid-to-solid). It was found that NH(4)-N is the decisive factor in leachate management, requiring the highest L/S-ratio (around 6) to meet the direct discharge limit values. Various scenarios were constructed to find optimal leachate management strategies both in large (waste height H = 25 m) and medium-sized landfills (H = 10 m) with corresponding temperature ranges. The results show that by minimizing the aftercare period length with leachate pre-treatment and recirculation, both sustainability and economic benefits can be achieved. The results provide new views on how to manage the long-term leachate aftercare problem. In the case of large landfills, further efforts are needed to reach stabilization within a reasonable time frame.},

The LMC1 challenge dataset was from a 0.34m deep 0.48m diameter laboratory test cell, and the LMC2 dataset was from a 55m×80m 8m deep landfill test cell which formed part of the Dutch sustainable landfill research programme at Landgraaf in the Netherlands. The paper describes developments in LDAT arising directly from the experience of responding to the two challenges, and discusses the model input and output data obtained from a calibration using the full datasets. The developments include the modularisation of the model into a set of linked sub-models, the strategy for converting conventional waste characteristics into model input parameters, the identification of flexible degradation pathways to control the CO2:CH4 ratio, and the application of a chemical equilibrium model that includes a stage in which the solid waste components dissolve into the leachate.},

abstract = {This paper describes the concept of a generic spatially distributed numerical model that has been developed to contain and link sub-models of landfill processes in order to simulate solid waste degradation and gas generation in landfills. The model includes the simulation of the transport of leachate and gases, and the consolidation of the solid waste. The structure of the model consists of linked discrete constant volume elements. The paper outlines the theoretical background that provides the framework to contain the numerical procedures that make up the model. Details are also given of the approach to the modelling of the chemistry and microbiology of solid waste degradation.},

abstract = {A landfill is a very complex heterogeneous environment and as such it presents many modelling challenges. Attempts to develop models that reproduce these complexities generally involve the use of large numbers of spatially dependent parameters that cannot be properly characterised in the face of data uncertainty. An alternative method is presented, which couples a simplified microbial degradation model with a stochastic hydrological and contaminant transport model. This provides a framework for incorporating the complex effects of spatial heterogeneity within the landfill in a simplified manner, along with other key variables. A methodology for handling data uncertainty is also integrated into the model structure. Illustrative examples of the model's output are presented to demonstrate effects of data uncertainty on leachate composition and gas volume prediction.},

@article{Zacharof2004,
abstract = {A mathematical model simulating the hydrological and biochemical processes occurring in landfilled waste is presented and demonstrated. The model combines biochemical and hydrological models into an integrated representation of the landfill environment. Waste decomposition is modelled using traditional biochemical waste decomposition pathways combined with a simplified methodology for representing the rate of decomposition. Water flow through the waste is represented using a statistical velocity model capable of representing the effects of waste heterogeneity on leachate flow through the waste. Given the limitations in data capture from landfill sites, significant emphasis is placed on improving parameter identification and reducing parameter requirements. A sensitivity analysis is performed, highlighting the model's response to changes in input variables. A model test run is also presented, demonstrating the model capabilities. A parameter perturbation model sensitivity analysis was also performed. This has been able to show that although the model is sensitive to certain key parameters, its overall intuitive response provides a good basis for making reasonable predictions of the future state of the landfill system. Finally, due to the high uncertainty associated with landfill data, a tool for handling input data uncertainty is incorporated in the model's structure. It is concluded that the model can be used as a reasonable tool for modelling landfill processes and that further work should be undertaken to assess the model's performance.},
