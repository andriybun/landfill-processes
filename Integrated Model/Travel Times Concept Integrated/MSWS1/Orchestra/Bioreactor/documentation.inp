ORCHESTRA Example 1

This example calculates the chemical speciation of carbonate in water as a funtion of pH.
Start the calculations by clicking the run button above.
The calculated ouput will appear under the output tab on the right. 


The tabs on the right: 

Chemistry
Here you can define the substances and reactions that are included in the calculations.
The "Change View" button allows to switch between text and graphical input mode.


Input
Here you can give values for selected cell variables.
You can use (nested) sweeps/ loops of variables, but also directly  
paste tables from a spreadsheet here. 
Any variable that is used within the chemistry module can be given a value here.

Examples of possible input variables:
CO3-2.liter // total amount of CO3-2 per liter
HCO3-.k   // formation constant of HCO3- species


Output
After a run the calculated ouput appears here.
Note that ORCHESTRA uses the column headers in the output file to determine the output
for the next run. So you can change the ouput by editing the column headers, and re-run the model.

The format of output and input files is  the same,
so ouput of one calculation could used as input for another calculation.

Any variable that is used within the chemistry module can used for output.

Examples of output variables:
HCO3-.con // concentration  of HCO3- species
HCO3-.logact // log activity of HCO3- species
HCO3-.k   // its formation constant
